# DEMO WEBSITE

This project depicts a simple way to retrieve data from gov.data.gr and plot them using **Chart.js** library. It has the same
behavior with the official data.gov.gr site but without using _React.js_ framework. The goal is to use simple libraries like _jQuery_ to
minimize the overhead and to keep it as simple as possible from a code perspective.
